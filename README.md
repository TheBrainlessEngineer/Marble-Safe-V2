# Marble-Safe-V2
New version of the marble safe, which has better tolerances, new bolt, stopper and visual designs and doesnÂ´t need bearings anymore.

You can download these STL Files to build your very own Marble Safe. 
I printed my version on an anycubic i3 mega, at 0.3 mm Layer height.
You may need to rescale/sand some parts for a perfect fit.
